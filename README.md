# Quizzapalooza - A Kahoot-like Web Application

Quizzapalooza is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django. It provides an interactive learning platform where educators can create quizzes and learners can participate in engaging quiz sessions.

- Quiz creation/deletion: Educators can create and delete quizzes with multiple-choice or true/false questions.
- Waiting hall: Students can join quiz sessions by providing a session ID and nickname.
- Competition session: Quizzes are conducted in a competitive environment with both teachers and students.
- Efficient server-client communication: Django channels and jQuery are used for real-time communication.
- Responsive design: The application utilizes Bootstrap for a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
- Database integration: PostgreSQL is used for quiz data storage, while MongoDB is used for competition data storage.
- CI/CD pipeline: A GitLab CI/CD pipeline is set up for testing, building Docker images, and deployment to Azure.
